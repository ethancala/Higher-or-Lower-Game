# Higher-or-Lower-game
This a Web application using HTML, JS, CSS with bootstrap, python with flask, and a MongoDb database. It is a simple higher or lower card game where users can wager in game currency.

How to Play:

The objective of the game is to accumulate in-game currency by wagering, aiming to win as many rounds or games of "Higher or Lower" as possible.

Each game consists of 5 rounds. A playing card is displayed to the user, who must then predict whether the next card's value will be higher or lower. If the user's guess is correct, they win the round and proceed to the next one. However, if the guess is incorrect, they lose the round but continue to the next. Winning 3 or more rounds results in winning the game, while losing 3 or more games leads to losing the game. The amount of currency wagered by the user, along with the game outcome (win or loss), determines the impact on their currency balance.

The user's account will maintain a currency balance. Additionally, users will have access to a game history section, which displays the total number of games played along with the win/loss status of each game (not individual rounds).
